# Fooberticus' Cajun Chicken and Smoked Sausage Jambalaya

Andouille is more authentic, but kielbasa or pretty much any other smoked sausage works great. 

Use a large pot with a lid, like a Lodge 6.5 quart enameled cast iron dutch oven.

I like to take my roux *just* to the brink of burnt. I keep the Trinity (onions, celery, bell pepper) in a mixing bowl close at hand, stirring and stirring the roux until it starts to smell *toasty*, but not burnt, and looks like the color of dark chocolate. Right at the moment when it smells done, dump in the Trinity to stop the roux from burning.

Don't forget to preheat the oven!

Servings: 4+

Total time: 3 hours

## Ingredients

* 1 package boneless/skinless chicken thighs (~1.5 - 2 lbs)
* 2 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more to taste
* freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons canola oil
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 4 ribs celery, diced
* 2 large yellow onion, diced
* 2 green bell peppers cored, seeded, and diced
* 8 garlic cloves, minced
* 1/8 teaspoon dried cayenne pepper
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 teaspoon dried basil
* 1/8 teaspoon dried thyme
* 1/8 teaspoon dried sage
* 2 Bay leaves
* 6 cups chicken stock (Low Sodium Better than Bouillon roasted chicken flavor)
* 1 pound andouille or other smoked sausage, sliced 1/4-inch thick
* 2 cups long grain rice
* 1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced

## Directions

1. Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan over medium-high. Add the chicken and cook, flipping once, until browned all over but not cooked through. Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside.
2. Heat the remaining oil in the saucepan. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until dark brown (like the color of chocolate).
3. Quickly add the celery, bell pepper, and onion and cook for 1 minutes, then stir in the garlic, cayenne pepper and dried herbs. Cook 1 minute more, then stir in the stock. Bring to a low simmer over medium-low, uncovered, stir in 1 tablespoon salt and the bay leaves. Simmer for 1 hour.
4. Heat the oven to 350Â°F while simmering. It has to be ready for the next step!
5. Stir in the sausage and rice. Nestle the chicken on top, bring to a boil, cover, and bake 30 minutes.
6. Carefully remove from the oven and stir in the scallions. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
